            Get Moving America would use anonymized data when displaying exercise information on the global heat map and leaderboards for regions and companies.
            On a users personal dashboard they would be able to track their own activity and get offers from companies with different rewards for meeting activity levels.
            The website would be the middle man that handles the users data so that the partnership companies would not have access to users data but instead would be able to give Get Moving America a product of offer that they want individuals who meet certain criteria to receive.
